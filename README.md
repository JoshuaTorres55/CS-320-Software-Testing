# CS-320 Software Testing Portfolio

This repository contains my work for **CS-320 Software Test, Automation QA**. It includes selected files from Project One and the summary and reflections report from Project Two. These artifacts show my work in software testing, automation, and quality assurance, along with my reflections on the course.

## Project One: Contact Service
Files included:  
- `Contact.java`  
- `ContactService.java`  
- `ContactTest.java`  
- `ContactServiceTest.java`  

These files show how I used unit testing to confirm the service was working as expected and how testing was applied to uncover issues early.

## Project Two: Summary and Reflections Report
This project includes my written summary and reflection report. It discusses testing strategies, lessons learned, and how the requirements were tested through automation and analysis.

## Reflection
To make sure my code and software are functional and secure, I rely on unit tests, boundary testing, and coverage analysis to confirm requirements are met and that the code behaves as expected. For security I follow good practices like validating inputs and making sure sensitive data is handled properly.  

I interpret user needs by looking closely at the requirements and translating them into specific features or behaviors in the program. I use the requirements to design tests so I know the program works the way the user expects it to.  

When I design software I start with the requirements and then break them into smaller parts that can be built and tested. I focus on keeping the design simple, reliable, and testable so it is easier to maintain and improve over time.
