# CS-320 Software Testing Portfolio

This repository showcases my work for CS-320 Software Test, Automation QA. It contains projects, JUnit tests, and reflections demonstrating my approach to software testing and test coverage.

## Project One: Contact, Task, and Appointment Services
A backend mobile application with three core services:
- **ContactService** – Manage contacts with full CRUD functionality
- **TaskService** – Track and update tasks
- **AppointmentService** – Schedule and manage appointments, avoiding conflicts

### Testing Highlights
- **Unit Testing** – Validates each service independently
- **Boundary Testing** – Handles edge cases like duplicates and overlaps
- **Coverage Analysis** – Ensures all functional requirements are tested
- **Reflections** – Discusses mindset, testing strategies, and lessons learned

## Repository Structure
- `/ProjectOne` – Source code for the three services
- `/Tests` – JUnit test files
- `/Reports` – Summary and reflections report
